          All modern websites and web applications are built using three
          <em>fundamental</em>
          technologies: HTML, CSS and JavaScript. These are the languages of the
          web.
        </p>
        <p>
          In this post, let's focus on HTML. We will learn what HTML is all
          about, and why you too should learn it.
        </p>

        <h3>What is HTML?</h3>
        <p>
          HTML stands for <strong>H</strong>yper<strong>T</strong>ext
          <strong>M</strong>arkup <strong>L</strong>anguage. It's a markup
          language that web developers use to structure and describe the content
          of a webpage (not a programming language).
        </p>
        <p>
          HTML consists of elements that describe different types of content:
          paragraphs, links, headings, images, video, etc. Web browsers
          understand HTML and render HTML code as websites.
        </p>

        <p>In HTML, each element is made up of 3 parts:</p>

        <ol>
          <li class="first-li">The opening tag</li>
          <li>The closing tag</li>
          <li>The actual element</li>
        </ol>

        <!-- to add a link we use <a></a> where a stand for anchor -->
        <!-- target="_blank" to open the link in a new tab -->
        <p>
          You can learn more at the
          <a href="https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/" target="_blank"
            >MDN Web Docs.</a
          >
        </p>

        <h3>Why should you learn HTML?</h3>

        <p>
          There are countless reasons for learning the fundamental language of
          the web. Here are 5 of them:
        </p>

        <ul>
          <li class="first-li">
            To be able to use the fundamental web dev language
          </li>
          <li>
            To hand-craft beautiful websites instead of relying on tools like
            Worpress or Wix
          </li>
          <li>To build web applications</li>
          <li>To impress friends</li>
          <li>To have fun ðŸ˜ƒ</li>
        </ul>

        <p>Hopefully you learned something new here. See you next time!</p>

<!-- Semantic HTML: we ask the question what this element actually mean and we what it stands for? -->
<!-- Examples: div has no meaning but nav represents a section of a page that links to other pages or to parts within the page: a section with navigation links, or p represents a paragraph -->
<!-- Semantic is important for search engine optimization, and also for accessibility (for blind people, ...) -->
